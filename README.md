## FibonacciLoop-FibonacciRecursive
 
 I implemented a function for finding the nth Fibonacci number using the MIPS assembly language. 
 
 Following gives the definition of the Fibonacci Sequence.

 Let F be the Fibonacci function:
 
 F(0) = 0
 
 F(1) = 1
 
 For n > 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
 
 Example Output of Execution:
 - Enter the sequence number: 6
 - F(6) = 8
 
 Loop Implementation:
 - In a file named FiboLoop.asm, implement the above function using a loop. 
 
 Recursive Implementation:
 - In a file named FiboRec.asm, implement the above function using a loop.
