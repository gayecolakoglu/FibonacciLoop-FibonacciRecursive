## FibonacciLoop-FibonacciRecursive
 
You will implement a function for finding the nth Fibonacci number using the MIPS assembly language. 
Following gives the definition of the Fibonacci Sequence. Your code should comply with the coding 
conventions described in the lectures.
Let F be the Fibonacci function:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
For n > 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Example Output of Execution:
Enter the sequence number: 6
F(6) = 8
... ### Loop Implementation
... In a file named FiboLoop.asm, implement the above function using a loop. 
... ### Recursive Implementation
... In a file named FiboRec.asm, implement the above function using a loop.
